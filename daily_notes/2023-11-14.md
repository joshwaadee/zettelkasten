## Activities

- Started using the Microsoft to-do app and initially it seems really useful
- Created the menus for Angel as she's off sick today. I appreciate the LaTeX system that I designed; it makes things very easy. 
- I tried out the version of the Rust Language book as published by Brown University. This is an interactive book and has quizzes and visualisations.
- I used GIMP to manipulate the canteen menus rather than using Adobe. This way I can make sure that the aspect ratio of the menu fits the ratio of the TV. 
- I hit a wall in learning Rust. I can't really understand the concept of dereferencing.

## Gratitudes

-  The Katsu curry at work today was one of the best I've ever had.
