## Activities

- I just learned about the clippy rust [[linter]]. It helps you write code idiomatically. It doesn't catch errors, the compiler does that. Instead, it helps you write cleaner, more concise code.  
- I met with the GMS estates to discuss the tech for their AGM tomorrow
- I have been trying to get through the section of the [Rust Language Book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html#rust-avoids-simultaneous-aliasing-and-mutation) That deals with referencing and dereferencing. I still struggle to get it. 

## Interesting links

- [Clippy linter](https://doc.rust-lang.org/clippy/usage.html)

## Gratitudes

- I'm grateful that, the lady who works at the coffee place I go to most mornings has memorised my order and even has it ready by the time I get to the front of the queue. I should probably learn her name.
