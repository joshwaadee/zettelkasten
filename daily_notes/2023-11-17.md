## Activities

- I had a call with [[Derrek Doe]], the account manager for the Inner Temple at ProAV. We discussed what might be brought up in his meeting with Priya next week. 
- Spoke with [[Priya]] about her conversation with Derek. We aim to have some more information about the movement of microphone WAP from the luncheon room to the Lecture Theatre and the asset register. Derek will also make sure that I get my lunch allowance pay after the original amount gets established. 
- I read briefly about [[Active Externalism]] and it's application in a [[Personal Knowledge Base]] system.
