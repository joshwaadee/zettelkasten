## Activities

- Fixed an error with Git when pulling from the remote repo.
- I updated the josh jobs excel file. I haven't done a lot in the past month to get these long-term projects done. 
- Had a meeting with [[Priya]] and [[Adam]] where we discussed the progress of the long-term projects that were outstanding. We also added some new projects. 

## Ideas

- Story idea: A Victorian mystic detective/ghost hunter has his child abducted by evil spirits. Along with his wife, they search the spirit world to find the child and defeat the evil spirits. 
	- Decide why the evil spirits want/need the child. Some kind of ritual?
	- should the wife die half way through?
	- Could this be a game?
- I read an article about what would happen if money had an expiry date.

## Gratitudes

- I started to play a game called Sword and Sworcery and it was a really inspiring experience. I like the idea of making games like that. The art style was simple pixel art but visually stunning.
