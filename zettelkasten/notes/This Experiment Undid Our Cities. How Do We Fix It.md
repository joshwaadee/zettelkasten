- 00:00:50 - Traditional development pattern - a city built by many hands. Essentially cities, without much planning structure, grew organically
- 00:02:00 - When Chicago was being developed, contractors would build a large variety of housing stock in the same neighbourhood to suit different needs and budgets
- 00:03:00 - ~Houses weren't intended to be permanent, they were built fairly cheaply and with the expectation of redevelopment in the future
- 00:03:17 - Cities are organised complexity and not chaotic. They are systems that are built from individual behaviours.
> "The rain forest is a chaotically diverse environment where all kinds of species have developed symbiotic relationships with each other. A mild disruption just means the ecosystem adjusts but doesn't collapse.
> The cornfield is a scientifically calibrated environment with predictable inputs and outputs. It's highly efficient at producing one thing and it's created other systems completely dependant upon it. **It's complicated but not complex**."

- 00:06:00 - Local authorities started to micro-manage their cities by using zoning laws that specified exactly what usage plots of land could have. They also restricted how densely built certain neighbourhoods could be. Cities moved away from growing and developing organically.
> "When a neighbourhood becomes more desirable, it can't adapt quickly enough to provide options for residents to stay"

- 00:09:00 - While regulating away the traditional way cities grew, they were subsidising the construction of a sprawling suburbia with mortgage subsidies and large-scale road infrastructure. all of which was enforced by zoning laws. 
- Zoning and regulation has created a housing crisis. People can only commute so far away from their jobs in the city centre, so we're running out of land to sprawl into. Developing current suburban land to have higher density is also illegal in most cities. Land keeps getting more expensive in the places people want or need to be to the point of un-affordability.
