# Extended Mind Thesis

Extended Mind Thesis is the idea that the mind doesn't just exist within our brains or the body, but actually involves external objects and even people. This means the environment we exist in forms an inseparable part of who we are and how we think. 

We can use this to our advantage of this by practicing [[Active Externalism]].
