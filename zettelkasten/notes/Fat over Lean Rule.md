# Fat over Lean Rule

Thick on thin is a principle of oil painting. It is the practise of using thinned paint at the beginning of the project and gradually using thicker and thicker paint at the project progresses. The idea being the layers of paint are made up of thicker paint as they get closer to the top. This method serves two purposes: firstly, it allows you to layer paint without smudging the layer beneath and secondly, it helps prevent your painting from cracking as it dries.
