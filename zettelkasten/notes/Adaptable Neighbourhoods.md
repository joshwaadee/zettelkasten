# Adaptable Neighbourhoods

An adaptable neighbourhood is one that changes alongside the needs of the people that live in it. For example, If the neighbourhood becomes more desirable and more people wish to live there then it can become more dense to accommodate the extra population. If the neighbourhood isn't adaptable (often because it's restricted by [[Zoning Laws]]) then as the desirability goes up and therefore demand for houses goes up, the price of housing goes up. This means that, rather than adapting with the people that live in the neighbourhood, a non-adaptive neighbourhood often prices out it's inhabitants. This is a major factor in [[Gentrification]].
