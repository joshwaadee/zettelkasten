# Principles of Note Taking

The idea behind this note is to develop [[Principles Over Practices]] for my note taking.

## I want my notes to be **easy**

- Easy to make notes [[Markdown]]
- Easy to find notes [[Tags vs Folders]]
- Easy to make and find relationships between notes [[Bottom Up, Not Top Down]]

## I want my notes to be future proof

- I don't want to rely on proprietary file formats


## I want my notes to adapt with me through time

- Flexible structure
- No constraints
