## Activities

- I sat in the functions meeting. It appears that I won't be going to the staff meal and I have to work. 
- I met with three people from the Mobile Economic Forum. We worked out a solution where, instead of using zoom, they are using a product called stream-yard to control what is being sent to the stream (camera/presentations/remote speakers etc) and this is being sent to a streaming service called Hop-on. It might help with the inn's qualifying sessions? 
- I gave an AV induction to Nick and Gerson. They seemed to pick things up really quickly. 
## Ideas

- It would be good to have a large rocket that uses hydrogen peroxide and kerosene as propellants. Thus far, only small rockets have used these propellants. 
- I think I should separate my daily notes form my zettelkasten. This way, I won't be clogging up my permanent notes with lots of daily thoughts.

## Gratitudes

- An ode to paracetamol: If it wasn't for the cheap and plentiful access to effective analgesics, I wouldn't have the freedom to drink on a work night.
