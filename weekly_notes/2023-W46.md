#weekly

---

This week I have tried to learn more about personal organisation techniques. The idea is that my brain is for having ideas, not storing them. One of these methods involves making daily and weekly notes to keep a record of what I did or achieved that day. I have also been making notes on topics that I find interesting and attempting to link them together as much as I can. I'm finding the whole process of forcing myself to write a little awkward at first, and as the handful of notes I have currently are fairly eclectic, linking notes seems like something that will get easier over time.
